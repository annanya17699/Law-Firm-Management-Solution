1. Start with Standard Profiles as a base, then clone and modify as needed.
2. Use Permission Sets to grant additional permissions for specific functions without changing the base profile.
3. Regularly review and audit profile permissions to ensure they align with business needs and security requirements.
4. Consider creating more granular profiles if significant permission differences are needed within a role category.

## Next Steps:
1. Review and adjust these profile definitions as needed for your project.
2. Create the profiles in your Salesforce org.
3. Assign appropriate users to each profile.
4. Test the profiles to ensure they provide the correct level of access.
5. Document any custom permissions or permission sets created to supplement these profiles.
